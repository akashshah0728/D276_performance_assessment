                    I am excited to apply for the EMS/SCADA Engineering position at PSEG. With a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, over three years of experience leading system-level design and implementation efforts, and current pursuit of a B.S./M.S. in Computer Science, I bring a unique blend of hardware familiarity and growing software and network knowledge—well-suited for supporting critical EMS/SCADA infrastructure at PSEG’s Electric System Operation Center.

                <p>
                    Throughout my engineering career, I’ve worked at the intersection of mechanical systems and digital tools—developing CAD models, managing large technical documentation sets, and overseeing the integration of mechanical components within larger system architectures. At Component Hardware Group, I’ve led cross-functional product development efforts that required not only mechanical expertise but also configuration control, vendor coordination, and iterative testing with clients—mirroring the attention to system reliability and precision required for EMS/SCADA systems.

                <p>
                    PSEG’s commitment to system reliability, cybersecurity, and innovation strongly resonates with my own values. I’m particularly excited by the opportunity to contribute to an organization that plays such a vital role in regional grid stability and energy security. I welcome the chance to bring my engineering experience and growing technical toolkit to your 24/7 operations support team.
